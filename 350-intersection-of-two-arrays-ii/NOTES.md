* Hashing
​
1. Time Complexity O(n)
​
2. Space complexity - O(n) It uses a map for first array, and array to store answer
​
* Populate a map which contains the element of first array as key and the count of it a value.
Traverse through the second array, if the element exist in Map and it count >0 then add the number to answer and decrese the count.
