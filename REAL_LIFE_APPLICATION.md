Array:
Seat of a theathre represents an 2D array

StacK:

The browser history is stored in stack usually so we can go back to the last visited pages.

Singly Linked List:

In a music player songs are connected, we play one song then we get the other song in the playlist automatically, that's because the songs are connected and we can consider them as nodes.

Doubly Linked List:

Sometime we would like to go back to the previous song played so that's where doubly Linked list comes in picture. From each of the song we can either go back or play the next song. .

Circular Linked List:

Sometime we would like the playlist to play the first song again once it finishes playing all or in simple terms repeat itself. That's where Circular linked list comes in picture.

Graph:

Google Map uses graph, each cities(nodes) are connected with some edges(path) that have some weight(distance). Google map uses graph algorithm to find the shortest path between two cities.

BST(Binary Search Tree):

It would take at worst n element to insert/delete an element from a sorted array. So we represent it using BST. So searching and Retrieval is mostly done using BST.
